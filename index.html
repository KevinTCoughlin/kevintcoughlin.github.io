  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The Idea</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m a podcast fanatic. For the past few years podcasts have filled hours of my day whether commuting, at work, at home, or while exercising. One of my favorite network of podcasts is the <a href="http://smodcast.com/">SModCo</a> network by Clerks director Kevin Smith. After listening to his podcasts on my iPod Touch for a year I received a decent Android phone and immediately began searching for a great SmodCo specific podcast app. I stumbled across an app named Smod Forever and it was decent. However, eventually the developer introduced abtrusive poorly coded advertisements and I had to give it up.</p>

<p>No more than 2 months after abandoning Smod Forever, a company introduced an application for Kevin Smith&rsquo;s podcast that is a re-skinned version of their <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/">Nerdist</a> and the <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/">Joe Rogan Experience</a> apps (Nerdist and Joe Rogan Experience are other popular podcasts). While the apps seemed better than the Smod Forever, I decided to try a general Podcast app that was highly rated &ndash; Doggcatcher.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve had a host of problems with Doggcatcher.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s really slow for my Samsung Galaxy Nexus</li>
<li>Syncing often fails</li>
<li>Sometimes Episodes are swapped</li>
<li>The design is cluttered</li>
<li>Error catching is non-existant</li>
</ul>


<p>Recently, my frustration reached its height and I decided it was time to write my own app.</p>

<h1>Android Beginnings</h1>

<p>For the past two years I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Android development. I like to think I know the platform very well, but due to my own shortcomings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Poor planning</li>
<li>Feature Happy</li>
<li>&lsquo;Perfectionism&rsquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve never published an application to Google&rsquo;s Play Store. I figured that creating an app I would use daily for a personality that I admire would be a damn good way to motivate myself. I&rsquo;d also learned from previous projects to boil the initial implementation to a few tasks and to do them well. So I came up the following requirements for Phase 1 of my Smodcast Android App:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adhere to current Android Design Patterns</li>
<li>Display list of Smodcast Episodes</li>
<li>Bottom fragment with Play / Pause functionality and currently playing label</li>
<li>At first only stream mp3 via HTTP</li>
</ul>


<p>However, my interests combined with a switch in projects at work has led me to&hellip;</p>

<h1>iOS &ndash; The Promised Land?</h1>

<p>I ended up working in iOS this past week at work. I know nothing of iOS aside from general principles and the syntax of Objective-C is still pretty much an unknown world to me. But I decided that it was time to take a deep-dive into XCode, Objective-C, and iOS development so that I knew what the hell I was doing both at home and at work.</p>

<p>During my break on Monday I spent began researching what I&rsquo;d need to develop my Smodcast app on iOS. I boiled it down to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>XML Parser (preferably SAX)</li>
<li>List view to display the episodes</li>
<li>Bottom view for currently playing text and Play / Pause button</li>
<li>Audio API</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Process</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>Started developing the iOS version of Smodr by looking up a simple RSS reader tutorial. Using that project as a base, I implemented my own Episode object versus a dictionary implementation. The list of episode was easily completed so I moved to implementing the bottom currently playing view I envisioned (borrowing heavily from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">Spotify&rsquo;s iOS app</a>). A few Google searches later I ended up on a StackOverflow thread recommending enabling the bottom toolbar property in the Navigation Controller. I quickly toggled the appropriate property, ran my application and saw my list of episodes with a bottom toolbar resembling an empty canvas. My work on Day 1 was complete.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m about 50% done with the rough phase 1 implementation. Today I focused on audio playback in iOS. I was led to two APIs, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html">AVAudioPlayer</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/mediaplayer/reference/MPMusicPlayerController_ClassReference/Reference/Reference.html">MPMusicPlayerController</a> but since I was planning on HTTP streaming for this proof-of-concept stage and MPMusicPlayerController only allows access to the iPod media collection, I chose AVAudioPlayer. Within a few minutes was able to initialize the correct media file off of the table cell selection and invoke my audio player. My next job was to create two items on the bottom toolbar I created the night before. Populating the bottom toolbar was the timesink for the second night, but eventually I was able to right align a UIBarButtonItem with the system included Play icon and respond to taps. I wrote a simple conditional checking the rate of playback to see if audio was playing then resumed or paused playback. I was satisfied and hit the sack.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>The next day I continued with the bottom toolbar by including a UIButtonBarItem that includes a UILabel denoting the current episode or an empty string if nothing is playing. Although I had to handle the label overflow, I switched back to the playback button. I wanted to toggle state between play and pause depending on either the player&rsquo;s rate property or a boolean value. The switching of images proved to be the biggest time sink due to my unfamiliarity with the iOS UI structure and my sleep deprivation. A few StackOverflow threads recommended not using the provided play and pause buttons and instead suggested to swap the image. I grabbed a play and pause png using iconfinder, initialized the UIImages, but was unable to change the button&rsquo;s image. Frustrated, I went to sleep. The next morning I immediately fired-up my laptop and gave it another try. After a full night&rsquo;s rest I realized that I was setting the image property of the UIBarButtonItem instead of the UIBarButton. I quickly deleted the few unwanted characters and rebuilt the application. Just like magic I was pausing / playing the audio and showing the appropriate button images. Win! Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of the app in its current state:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s4bTTxc.png" alt="Smodr - iOS App" /></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>So far iOS has been a joy to work with. I&rsquo;m well aware that all I have in this initial phase is an app that&rsquo;s barely usable outside of the simulator due to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of storage</li>
<li>HTTP streaming</li>
<li>Battery life</li>
<li>Network requests and connectivity</li>
<li>Data usage</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>But I&rsquo;ve finally got the basic functionality down and started implementing the more advanced features today. And unlike usual, I&rsquo;m still having a great time developing. My biggest puzzle if I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m making so much progress in such a short amount of time&hellip; I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to a combination of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>This new environment, language, opportunity has excited and motivated me</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve grown as a developer and my skillset has improved since I last attempted a mobile app</li>
<li>The iOS framework is well designed.</li>
<li>XCode is a superior IDE</li>
<li>Tutorials and StackOverflow answers are of higher quality than other platforms</li>
<li>I finally &ldquo;get it&rdquo; when it comes to the architecture of mobile apps</li>
</ul>


<p>However, what I do know for sure is that I&rsquo;m really enjoying myself and love seeing progress every day. I&rsquo;m totally amazed at the amount of work I&rsquo;ve done without being completely comfortable with the syntax of the language and Apple&rsquo;s APIs. So if anyone has been on the fence, I say &ldquo;Go for it!&rdquo;. You may very well surprise yourself like I did. Now back to coding so that I can finally ship quality software!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whenever life doesn&rsquo;t go the way I planned, I&rsquo;m drawn to the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>if you’re going to try, <br/>
go all the way. <br/>
otherwise, don’t even start.</p>

<p>this could mean losing girlfriends,  <br/>
wives, relatives, jobs and  <br/>
maybe your mind.</p>

<p>it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.  <br/>
it could mean freezing on a  <br/>
park bench.  <br/>
it could mean jail,  <br/>
it could mean derision,  <br/>
it could mean mockery,  <br/>
isolation.  <br/>
isolation is the gift,  <br/>
all the others are a test  <br/>
of your endurance,  <br/>
of how much you really want to  <br/>
do it.   <br/>
and you’ll do it  <br/>
despite rejection and the worst odds   <br/>
and it will be better than   <br/>
anything else  <br/>
you can imagine.</p>

<p>if you’re going to try,  <br/>
go all the way.  <br/>
there is no other feeling like that.  <br/>
you will be alone with the gods  <br/>
and the nights will flame with fire.</p>

<p>you will ride life  <br/>
straight to perfect laughter,  <br/>
it&rsquo;s the only good fight there is.</p>

<p><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a></cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Life is short and difficult and there&rsquo;s no time to let it beat down on you. Sometimes you just need to pick your head up and focus on self-improvement. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Configure Android Studio to use an HTTP Proxy</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve had problems using Android Studio or the Android SDK Manager behind a Firewall then these two configuration changes may help you configure your development environment. First, configure your Android studio to bypass the firewall by changing its HTTP Proxy settings. To do this navigate to <code>Preferences &gt; HTTP Proxy</code>. You&rsquo;ll be presented with the following dialog:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/btmwNDC.png" alt="Android Studio HTTP Proxy Settings Dialog" /></p>

<p>Configure Android Studio to use your HTTP Proxy by filling in the inputs with the correct settings. Once you&rsquo;re done you can check that the proxy works by pressing the <code>Check Connection</code> button and entering a URL that is typically blocked by your firewall.</p>

<h2>Configure the Android SDK Manager to use an HTTP Proxy</h2>

<p>If your Android SDK Manager is unable to make HTTP calls while installing / updating then you can edit its configuration file to use an HTTP Proxy. To do this you&rsquo;ll need to edit its config file named <code>androidtools.cgf</code>. If you are on a UNIX machine you can typically find it at the following path: <code>~/.android/androidtool.cfg</code>. Once you open the config file in an editor, append / modify the http proxy and http port settings like the following:</p>

<pre><code>sdkman.force.http=true
http.proxyPort=[PORT NUMBER]
http.proxyHost=[IP ADDRESS]
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>[PORT NUMBER]</code> and <code>[IP ADDRESS]</code> are the correct settings for your HTTP proxy and the first line forces the manager to use HTTP. Save your modifications to the configuration file and you should then be able to fetch and install SDK assets behind your firewall.</p>

<p>Hope those two tips help you configure your Android development environment behind a firewall!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With Firefox OS phones <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a509168/zte-open-firefox-phone-going-hands-on-with-the-sold-out-handset.html">beginning to ship</a> and developer resources &amp; tools maturing in the past few months, the tech community&rsquo;s interest in the web technology-based OS has been rapidly climbing. But this is obvious to you because that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here! Right?</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts that will catalogue my journey developing for the Firefox OS. We&rsquo;ll begin by setting up our Simulator and becoming proficient with it. Included in these posts are useful links (many of which are from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla&rsquo;s Developer Network</a>) and provide essential supplemental material. Some of the articles are more detailed version of my content, therefore I strongly urge that you take the time to read their material in addition to mine as I am just capturing my development experience and may not answer all the questions you may have. If at any point you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="http://twitter.com/kevintcoughlin">@kevintcoughlin</a> or by commenting on the post. Now, enough of me blabbering&hellip; Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Part 1 of this D3.js introduction, we are going to append 200 circles of random size and color to random locations of a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) HTML element (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">Mozilla Developer Network: SVG</a>). This brief and simplistic tutorial will help familiarize you with a fraction of D3.js&#8217; core functionality and its expressive power.

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>QUnit is a JavaScript Unit Testing Framework originally developed by John Resig that is now maintained by the jQuery team. It is a powerful JavaScript testing library and an alternative to other testing frameworks such as <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a>. QUnit is often recommended as the first unit testing library to pickup for JavaScript due to its less steep learning curve yet extendability. I’m not able to comment on that statement since QUnit is the only JavaScript testing framework I have experience with so far. However, I hope to revisit the recommendation once I am able to evaluate the other offerings.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a solution if you ever run into the following issue while running cURL:</p>

<pre><code>$ [curl] 56: Received HTTP code 407 from proxy after CONNECT
