<p>With Firefox OS phones <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a509168/zte-open-firefox-phone-going-hands-on-with-the-sold-out-handset.html">beginning to ship</a> and developer resources &amp; tools maturing in the past few months, the tech community&rsquo;s interest in the web technology-based OS has been rapidly climbing. But this is obvious to you because that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here! Right?</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts that will catalogue my journey developing for the Firefox OS. We&rsquo;ll begin by setting up our Simulator and becoming proficient with it. Included in these posts are useful links (many of which are from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla&rsquo;s Developer Network</a>) and provide essential supplemental material. Some of the articles are more detailed version of my content, therefore I strongly urge that you take the time to read their material in addition to mine as I am just capturing my development experience and may not answer all the questions you may have. If at any point you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="http://twitter.com/kevintcoughlin">@kevintcoughlin</a> or by commenting on the post. Now, enough of me blabbering&hellip; Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h2>Supplemental Mozilla Post</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator/Simulator_Walkthrough">Firefox OS Simulator Walkthrough</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The Firefox OS Simulator plugs into the Firefox browser and provides a test environment for their OS that emulates a Firefox mobile device. Before moving forward, make sure that you have the Firefox browser installed on your machine. If not, you can download a version from the following URLs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Standard Build</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Nightly Build</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed the browser, open it and navigate to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/">Firefox OS Simulator plugin page</a>. Press the &ldquo;+ Add to Firefox&rdquo; button to install the simulator plugin in your browser. The browser will prompt you to allow the installation of the software. Press <code>Allow</code> and you&rsquo;ll see the plugin installation progress.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SA9EXDf.png" title="Allow Simulator Plugin Installation" alt="Allow Firefox OS Simulator Plugin Installation" /></p>

<p>The following screen will prompt you to authorize the installation of the plugin in your browser. Once the install button timer completes press &ldquo;Install&rdquo; and Firefox will successfully install the Simulator plugin.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DrECRjN.png" title="Install Firefox OS Simulator Plugin" alt="Install Firefox OS Simulator Plugin" /></p>

<h2>Check Installation</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check that the Firefox OS Simulator installed successfully. To do this it is not necessary to restart the browser. Navigate to <code>Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Firefox OS Simulator</code> and you should be presented with the following new tab.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qqZnr1s.png" title="Simulator Dashboard" alt="Firefox OS Simulator Dashboard" /></p>

<p>This tab contains the dashboard for your Simulator which contains the apps you create / import along with the toggle switch for turning the mobile simulator on and off. Let&rsquo;s fire-up the simulator by switching the Simulator toggle to &ldquo;Running&rdquo;. Now a new window should pop-up named <code>B2G</code> (Boot2Gecko) and you should see an emulated Firefox mobile device like the following:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nOZEp67.png" title="Simulator Device" alt="Firefox OS Simulator Device" /></p>

<h2>Testing an App</h2>

<p>Now that our environment is ready to rock let&rsquo;s give the Simulator its first application to run. The Mozilla employee working on Firefox OS, Rob Nyman (<a href="https://github.com/robnyman">Github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/robertnyman">@robertnyman</a>) has provided an excellent Firefox OS bootstrap application that we&rsquo;ll use to test the Simulator. His application showcases the basic functionality of the OS and provides a good code base to extend into your own applications. To deploy the boilerplate app to our Simulator, input either of the two links into the <code>URL for page or manifest.webapp</code> input box in the top right corner.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://robnyman.github.com/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/manifest.webapp">http://robnyman.github.com/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/manifest.webapp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://robnyman.github.com/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/">http://robnyman.github.com/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QhHBQkk.png" title="Simulator URL Input Field" alt="Firefox OS Simulator URL Input Field" /></p>

<p><em>NOTE: If you don&rsquo;t use the <code>manifest.webapp</code> URL then you&rsquo;ll have to modify the app&rsquo;s launch image path for the app to deploy without warnings (See the <code>Using the Directory URL</code> Section). Therefore it&rsquo;s easier to use the <code>.webapp</code> path for this example.</em></p>

<p>Once you input the URL, the Firefox OS will automatically deploy the package to your Simulator and activate the Simulator and application. If you have done everything correctly, you&rsquo;ll see the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MSx4gxp.png" title="Deployed Firefox OS Boilerplate App" alt="Deployed Firefox OS Boilerplate App" /></p>

<p>In this app you can play around with the basic functionality of Firefox OS.</p>

<h3>Using the Directory URL</h3>

<p>If you use the directory link rather than the manifest.webapp URL then a quick modification must be made so that the Simulator has the correct launcher image. Otherwise it will appear without a launcher image and fire the following warning: <code>app submission to the Marketplace needs at least an 128 icon</code>. To fix this, you&rsquo;ll need to edit the following line <code>"launch_path": "/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/index.html"</code>. Rob covers this in the following section of his <code>README.md</code>:</p>

<p><em>Note: If you use the Add Directory option in the Simulator, or if you are trying to package (zip) for a future upload in the marketplace, make sure to change &ldquo;launch_path&rdquo;: &ldquo;/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/index.html&rdquo; to &ldquo;launch_path&rdquo;: &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; and the icon paths accordingly since it runs it as a packaged app directly from the root folder of the Firefox OS Boilerplate App.</em></p>

<p>To accomplish this, either fork or download the repository so that you can modify the <code>manifest.webapp</code> file. Then copy the URL of the modified directory into the simulator.</p>

<h2>Removing an App</h2>

<p>To remove an application from your Simulator, navigate to the Simulator&rsquo;s dashboard and click the <code>X</code> to the right of the app that you wish to remove. The app will then be listed like it is in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ns1vmWm.png" title="Removed Firefox OS Boilerplate App" alt="Removed Firefox OS Boilerplate App" /></p>

<p>You can undo the removal by clicking the dashboard&rsquo;s <code>Undo</code> button. Note that it&rsquo;s preferable not to remove the app via Firefox OS&rsquo;s long press on the icon method as it will not be synced with the Simulator dashboard.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time to be a web developer. Open web technologies are advancing at break-neck speed thanks to the resurgence of Open Source Software due in large-part to Github and popular tech like Node.js and JavaScript frameworks. Firefox&rsquo;s Operating System at the very least is an excellent platform to hack on for any JavaScript developer as it has extremely low barriers to entry for most web developers.</p>

<p>In Part 2 of this series, I&rsquo;ll start developing the application and have it fetch JSON data and populate the views.</p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>As you move towards developing your own applications for Firefox OS I recommend you supplementing my series of tutorials with the links listed above and below. In particular, Mozilla provides a more detailed walkthrough of the Simulator installation process and features at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Installing_the_Simulator_add-on">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Installing_the_Simulator_add-on</a>  You will greatly benefit from becoming acquainted with Firefox&rsquo;s Marketplace Developer Hub and reading through the Simulator walkthrough and API reference listed below. Mozilla does a fantastic job at creating high-quality material for developers.</p>
