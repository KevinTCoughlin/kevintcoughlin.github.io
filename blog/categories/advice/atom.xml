    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever life doesn&rsquo;t go the way I planned, I&rsquo;m drawn to the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>if you’re going to try, <br/>
go all the way. <br/>
otherwise, don’t even start.</p>

<p>this could mean losing girlfriends,  <br/>
wives, relatives, jobs and  <br/>
maybe your mind.</p>

<p>it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.  <br/>
it could mean freezing on a  <br/>
park bench.  <br/>
it could mean jail,  <br/>
it could mean derision,  <br/>
it could mean mockery,  <br/>
isolation.  <br/>
isolation is the gift,  <br/>
all the others are a test  <br/>
of your endurance,  <br/>
of how much you really want to  <br/>
do it.   <br/>
and you’ll do it  <br/>
despite rejection and the worst odds   <br/>
and it will be better than   <br/>
anything else  <br/>
you can imagine.</p>

<p>if you’re going to try,  <br/>
go all the way.  <br/>
there is no other feeling like that.  <br/>
you will be alone with the gods  <br/>
and the nights will flame with fire.</p>

<p>you will ride life  <br/>
straight to perfect laughter,  <br/>
it&rsquo;s the only good fight there is.</p>

<p><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a></cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Life is short and difficult and there&rsquo;s no time to let it beat down on you. Sometimes you just need to pick your head up and focus on self-improvement. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
